# Repository change
We've made a change in how this repository works. The default branch used to be v3, and the master branch a copy of the v2 branch. We have now copied v3 to master and set the default to be master. 

# v3.4.0
- add cordova-sqlcipher-adapter

# v3.3.0
- add cordova-plugin-android-permissions plugin to support permissions dialog
- increment cordova-plugin-nearby-connections@0.5.0
